Easy convention management system.

It provides:

- Blogging platform
- Attendees, volunteers and speakers management
- Resources distribution
- Events
- Communication
- Data sharing
- User-friendly API with OAuth2 provider

## Why bother?

I've created this system as a replacement for [SZIM][SZIM], which was created
by my friend in PHP as a management system for [Pyrkon][Pyrkon]. It is quite
nice tool, but lack some flexibility and API for developers.

Also I needed to create e-learning platform for volunteers, and SZIM doesn't
provide any tool that will allow work them together.
